## **Introduction**
Hello! Welcome to <strong>Scourse Card</strong>

Follow this link to to Scourse Card! [link](https://scourse-card.herokuapp.com/)

Apart from coding, my favorite hobby is to golf! I love golf because it's only ever a game between myself and the course and my only goal is to continue to improve my game!  I created this app to help myself and other fellow golfers keep track of their scores as well as the courses they play. Being able to keep track of your scores will greatly contribute to your ongoing improvement!

## **Instructions**

1. Upon initializing the app, the user will be able to go through the main page and decide if they want to check out the golf courses or the golfers.

2. The user without logging in will be able to look at all the courses that have been added.

3. If the user wants to check out the details of the individual golf courses they will then be sent to the Google login in page.

4. Once logged in the user will have access to all the profiles, will also be able to add to the golf course lists and add reviews!

5. The nav bar will display on the screen at all times. Giving the user the option to login or logout whenever they please.

## **Languages**
1. Javascript 
2. CSS 
3. HTML

## **Wireframe**
For the wireframe I used the green and yellow color scheme from the Masters and I tried to implement that color scheme throughout.

## **Next Steps**
1. Look up the actual formula used to determine a players Handicap and implement that in my app.
2. I want to expand the reviews Schema. I can add the course conditions, ratings, facitlities, etc!
3.
