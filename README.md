## **Introduction**
Hello! Welcome to <strong>Scourse Card</strong>

Follow this link to to Scourse Card! [link](https://scourse-card.herokuapp.com/)

Apart from coding, my favorite hobby is to golf! I love golf because it's only ever a game between myself and the course and my only goal is to continue to improve my game!  I created this app to help myself and other fellow golfers keep track of their scores as well as the courses they play. Being able to keep track of your scores will greatly contribute to your ongoing improvement!

## **Instructions**

1. Upon initializing the app, the user will be able to go through the main page and decide if they want to check out the golf courses or the golfers.

2. The user will then click on a category, and immideately be taken to their first quiz.

3. All categories consist of a 5 question quiz, each question being worth 20 points. 

4. At the end, the user will be told his score out of the possible 100 points.

5. The home page will automatically come up shortly after finishing your last question from the previous quiz. The user will now have the option to try any of the 4 categories again as many times as they please.

6. At the top right corner of the application, the user will find a Dark button, the user can click on it to switch between light and dark mode.

## **Languages**
1. Javascript 
2. CSS 
3. HTML

## **Wireframe**
For the wireframe I wanted to keep it simple. A quiz can be hard enough, there was no need for me to add too much and make it distracting for the user.

## **Next Steps**
1. Individually style each different quiz box. Depending on the category.
2. Add more questions to each category, making it much harder.
3. Add a high score section.
4. Clean up the code to make it much more concise
